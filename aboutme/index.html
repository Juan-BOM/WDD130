    <h2>Juan</h2>

    <p>My name is Juan Bernardo Ospina. You can call me Juan. I am 24 years old, I am from Canada (Born in Colombia, lived in Canada most of my life). I can speak 3 languages English, Spanish, and Russian. I am not married. I am a full time student and work on campus.</p>

    <p>I recently changed my major to Computer Engineering and am taking this class to understand what aspects of this major I enjoy most. I am hoping to come away from this course with the base knowledge of html, and CSS to be capable of simple web design projects. I see it as a great advantage to be able to design not just working applications through different coding languages but also the ability to make them visually appealing and easy to use with the skills I will learn during this course.</p>

    <p>Some of my hobbies include watching anime and learning/practicing languages. Thanks for taking the time to read my about me webpage!</p>
